This repo is a progress journal for learning Next.js.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is a framework for React that prides itself on server-side rendering and zero config setup with Webpack under the hood. 

Looking for simple server-side rendering? 
Static site generating? 
Seamless client side routing?
React on comfortable steriods? 

Next.js provides it.
